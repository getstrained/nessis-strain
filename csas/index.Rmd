What should you takeaway?

*   NOT necessarily the code (you can always go back and run the code later)

*   focus on the **process** and **concepts**

*   how to present results

--

Focus: American football (NFL)

Case study: Developing a pass rush metric<br>(inspired by a 2023 NFL Big Data Bowl finalist entry)

---

# Outline

*   Player tracking data and NFL Big Data Bowl overview

*   Data overview, preparation, and visualization

*   Metric formulation

---

# Data prep: Field standardization

--

-   In the raw data, there are 2 play directions (with respect to the offense): left and right

--

-   We need to standardize player tracking coordinates, so that the offense is always moving in the same direction

    - Helpful for feature engineering and modeling

Metric Formulation
</b>
</p>

# Metric background

GOAL: Create a metric to evaluate pass rushers in the NFL

--

Performance metrics based on tracking data can be classified into two types:

*   directly-derived - directly calculated from data

*   model-based - estimated through statistical model

--

**Our proposed metric is directly-derived**

Check out this review paper on [Player Tracking Data in Sports](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-033021-110117) by Kovalchik (2023)

# Metric brainstorming

How do we measure pass rusher effectiveness?

* Distance to QB

* Speed toward QB

--

Think simple... 

*   Ideally, this measure should increase as speed increases and distance decreases 

*   Consider speed divided by distance

# Measuring pressure at the frame-level

**Definition** ( $\text{STRAIN}$; informal)

For every pass rusher at each frame within a play, calculate

--

*   $d$: distance between pass rusher and QB

--

*   $v$: velocity at which pass rusher is moving toward QB

--

    *   estimated by rate of change in distance between current & previous frames

    *   $\displaystyle \frac{\text{change in distance}}{\text{change in time}} = \frac{\text{current frame's distance} - \text{previous frame's distance}}{0.1}$

--

*   $\text{STRAIN} = \displaystyle - \frac{v}{d}$


---

# Advantages of STRAIN

*   Simple, computation friendly: 2 features! #PutThatInYourXGBoost

--

*   Interpretable: 1/STRAIN <br> $\rightarrow$ time required for a pass rusher to get to QB with current velocity & distance

--

*   Scalable: can be applied to every passing play (minus trick plays)

--

*   Continuous-time within-play metric

    *   Previous metrics are either discrete or based on subjective judgment
    
    *   Play-level stats: sacks, hits, and hurries
    
    *   Pass rush win rate: uses an arbitrary time thresold to define a pass rush win; converts continuous data to a win-loss indicator

---

# Implementing STRAIN

What are the steps?

* Filter data to keep only frames between ball snap and a QB event (e.g., sack, pass forward, etc.)

* Identify locations of passer and pass rusher within each play

* Calculate distance and velocity, then STRAIN

---

# Implementing STRAIN

* Identify the starting and ending events, then collect the first observed start and end frames for each play

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tracking_start_end <- tracking |>
  distinct(gameId, playId, frameId, event) |>
  mutate(is_start = as.numeric(event %in% c("autoevent_ballsnap", "ball_snap")),
         is_end = as.numeric(event %in% c("fumble", "handoff", "lateral", "autoevent_passforward", 
                                          "pass_forward", "qb_sack", "qb_strip_sack", "run"))) |>
  group_by(gameId, playId) |>
  mutate(any_start = any(is_start == 1), any_end = any(is_end == 1)) |>
  filter(any_start, any_end) |>
  summarize(start_frame = frameId[which(is_start == 1)[1]],
            end_frame = frameId[which(is_end == 1 & frameId > start_frame)[1]]) |>
  ungroup()
```

* Join with tracking data and filter frames

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tracking <- tracking |>
  left_join(tracking_start_end, by = c("gameId", "playId")) |>
  filter(!is.na(start_frame), !is.na(end_frame),
         frameId >= start_frame, frameId <= end_frame) |>
  mutate(frameId_corrected = frameId - start_frame)
```


---

# Implementing STRAIN

* Use PFF scouting data to identify player role for each play

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tracking_roles <- tracking |>
  left_join(pffScoutingData, by = c("gameId", "playId", "nflId"))
```

* Get passer location for every frame of each play

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tracking_qb <- tracking_roles |>
  filter(pff_role == "Pass", pff_positionLinedUp == "QB") |>
  select(gameId, playId, frameId, x_qb = x, y_qb = y) 
```

---

# Implementing STRAIN

* Get pass rusher location, then join with passer location, and compute the two features distance and velocity

```{r, echo=TRUE}
tracking_pass_rush <- tracking_roles |>
  filter(pff_role == "Pass Rush") |>
  left_join(tracking_qb) |>
  group_by(gameId, playId, nflId) |>
  mutate(d_qb = sqrt((x - x_qb) ^ 2 + (y - y_qb) ^ 2),
         v_qb = -(d_qb - lag(d_qb)) / 0.1,
         strain = v_qb / d_qb) |>
  ungroup()
```

`tracking_pass_rush` will be the main data frame with pass rusher info including STRAIN

# Data viz plan

Goal: The visuals should tell stories and provide takeaway messages

*   Viz 1: Updated version of animation for example play

    *   Point size for each pass rusher represent their STRAIN at each frame

    *   Highlight focused player (M. Crosby) with a different color

*   Viz 2: How do the feature (distance, velocity, STRAIN) for M. Crosby interact within the play?

    *   Line graph showing how each feature change as the play evolves

Metric Validation
</b>
</p>

---

# Does the metric actually make sense?

--

**Face validity**: Who are the top players according to the metric? Does it pass the "eye test"?

--

[**"Meta-metrics"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09830) - Franks et al. (2017)

--

-   Discrimination: Does the metric differentiate between players? (across different positions? play outcomes?)

-   Stability/predictability: Is the metric stable over time? How does the metric relate to previous metrics?

-   Independence: Does the metric provide new information?

# Ranking the best pass rushers

Goal: obtain a leaderboard of the top-performing pass rushers based on the average STRAIN across all frames played

Note: we will consider players with at least 100 snaps played as pass rushers

First, get players with at least 100 snaps played as pass rushers

# Ranking the best pass rushers

*   Columns: player, team, position, snaps played, average STRAIN

*   Color gradient for metric column

# Metric stability

Is previous performance predictive of future performance based on the metric? (How much does our metric vary over time?)

What's the correlation between a player's performance on our metrics in the first and second halves of the provided data (i.e. first 4 weeks vs last 4 weeks)?

# Is STRAIN predictive of pressure than pressure itself?

Exercise. Make 2 scatterplots:

*   Pressure rate (first 4 weeks) vs Pressure rate (last 4 weeks)

*   Average STRAIN (first 4 weeks) vs Pressure rate (last 4 weeks)

Which plot depicts a stronger relationship?

---

# Is STRAIN predictive of pressure than pressure itself?

The answer is yes, as shown in our paper

# Advices

* Do it!

* Keep it simple. Don't try to do too much. Focus on a specific aspect.

* Think outside the box. Adapt concepts from other fields (physical sciences, etc.)

* Slick data viz is key

* Write (and prune words) as you work

* Enjoy learning (and the struggle)
